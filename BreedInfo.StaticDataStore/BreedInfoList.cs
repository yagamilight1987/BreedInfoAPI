The hair on the face is longer than the rest of the body giving it a distinct look. It is a smaller version of a working terrier and is not a delicate dog. It has a square body, with a moderately broad, deep chest. The head is round with a pronounced stop, which is the transition area from the backskull to the muzzle. The lower jaw is undershot, and broad enough for the lower teeth to be straight and even, protruding below the dog's short nose. The prominent, round eyes are black. The neck is short and arched and the limbs are straight and well boned. The tail is carried high and docked to two-thirds its length. The hairy ears are customarily docked, pointed and erect, however some countries have banned docking of animal's tails and ears. The coat is usually black or dark gray, but can also come in lighter gray, silver, red, or black and tan. The undercoat is slightly curly.\",\"temperament\":\"The Affenpinscher has a terrier-like personality. They tend to get along with other dogs and pets, especially when they are raised with them. They are busy, bold, inquisitive and stubborn, but they also love to monkey around, being playful and mischievous. A lively, sharp-witted little dog that is courageous and confident. A fearless defender, the Affenpinscher will quickly become an authoritarian if owners do not give the proper rules, boundaries, limitations and constantly be this dog’s pack leader. It is very affectionate and amusing. This friendly little dog enjoys being with its family. It needs consistent, firm training. Make sure there is some variety in the training so the dog does not become bored. They learn commands very quickly. Some may be difficult to housebreak. They are not recommended for very young children, simply because most people who own the breed treat them like small dogs, lacking the proper pack leadership, causing negative behaviors to come out in the dog. Children should be taught how to properly handle a dog. Owners need to consistently be the dog's pack leader to avoid the tendency to guard their food and toys. They like to hike and go camping. Without leadership, it may unwisely challenge large dogs and other large animals. They tend to bark and even climb. This little dog does best with a family who likes entertainment and has a very good sense of humor. Any dog that displays growling, snapping or biting is lacking in pack leadership. These issues can be corrected as soon as the humans take control back from the dog.\",\"height\":\"Height: 10 - 15 inches (25 - 38 cm)\",\"weight\":\"7 - 8 pounds (3 - 3.36 kg)\",\"healthProblems\":\"Some are prone to fractures, slipped stifle, PDA (patent ductus arteriosus), open fontanel and respiratory problems in hot weather.\",\"livingConditions\":\"The Affenpinscher is good for apartment life. They are very active indoors and will do okay without a yard. These dogs are sensitive to temperature extremes. Overly warm living conditions are damaging to the coat.\",\"exercise\":\"The Affenpinscher needs a daily walk. While out on the walk the dog must be made to heel beside or behind the person holding the lead, as in a dog's mind the leader leads the way, and that leader needs to be the human. Play will take care of a lot of their exercise needs, however, as with all breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs that do not get to go on daily walks are more likely to display behavior problems. They will also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off lead, such as a large fenced-in yard. Teach them to enter and exit door and gateways after the humans.\",\"lifeExpectancy\":\"About 10-14 years\",\"litterSize\":\"1 - 3 puppies, average 2\",\"grooming\":\"The Affenpinscher's harsh coat should never be clipped short because this ruins the coat for many years. It should be brushed and combed weekly and it may be necessary to pluck it. A dog-trimming specialist usually does this but it is possible to learn how to do it yourself. Show dogs require stripping. Hair sometimes grows in the corners of the eyes, causing irritation; they should be dealt with promptly. This breed sheds little to no hair.\",\"origin\":\"No exact data about the Affenpinscher's origin exists, but it is one of the most ancient of the toy breeds. It is certainly related to the Brussels Griffon and probably to the terrier. It's named \\\"Monkey Dog\\\" because of its monkey-like facial structure and expression. It is believed that the Affenpinscher originated in Germany, and the name Affenpinscher translated from German is \\\"Monkey Terrier.\\\" It is believed that the first Affenpinschers were larger in size as they were farm dogs that worked as ratters. The Affenpinscher was miniaturized and became a house pet during the 18th and 19th centuries. It is still a ruthless hunter of mice and an outstanding watchdog. Today the Affenpinscher is primarily a companion dog. The Affenpinscher was admitted to the American Kennel Club's studbook in 1936.\"},{\"name\":\"african\",\"description\":\"The Africanis can come in any color.

Good with kids and very social.\",\"height\":\"20-24 inches (50-60 cm)\",\"weight\":\"55-100 inches (25-45 kg)\",\"healthProblems\":\"Fairly healthy breed. The ridgeback types have been associated with a dermoid sinus and therefore breeding of ridgebacks is not encouraged\",\"livingConditions\":\"The Africanis will do ok in an apartment and without a yard if it is taken for daily pack walks. The Africanis should be protected from the cold.\",\"exercise\":\"If kept in a residential area, the Africanis dog should be walked daily to fulfill their primal canine instinct to walk. In addition, it should be given regular opportunities to run and play. Make sure any yard in which they can run loose has a fence high enough to prevent its determined efforts to escape and explore if the area is unsafe.\",\"lifeExpectancy\":\"About 9-12 years\",\"litterSize\":\"About 2 to 8 puppies\",\"grooming\":\"The smooth, shorthaired, hard coat is easy to groom. Comb and brush with a firm bristle brush, and shampoo only when necessary. Loose hair can be removed by wiping over with a warm, damp washcloth.

The skull is about the same length as the muzzle, with a very slight stop that is hard to see. The head is long and flat. The nose is black. The teeth should meet in a level, vice-like or scissors bite. The small eyes are dark in color. The V-shaped ears fold slightly to the side of the head and forward. The chest is deep. The topline of the back is level. The front legs are perfectly straight. The tail is set high on the back. The double coat has a hard, dense and wiry outer coat with a soft undercoat. Coat colors include tan and black and tan and grizzle. The head and ears should be tan, with the ears being a slightly darker shade of tan. The legs, thighs, elbows and the under part of the body and chest are also tan, sometimes running into the shoulder. In some lines there is a small white blaze on the chest. The back of the dog, sides and upper parts of the body should be black or dark grizzle in color.\",\"temperament\":\"The Airedale Terrier will usually do okay with children if they have early exposure and socialization, however they may play too rough for very small ones. Courageous and protective. Fairly friendly with strangers. Intelligent, pleasant and loyal. Sensitive and responsive, he can be obedience trained at a high level. Airedale Terriers are fun-loving and playful when they are puppies. Airedales will be happy to please you if there is nothing more pressing in the environment (chipmunk, other dog, food). An Airedale is extremely loyal, but as an avid hunter you would have to be an ace trainer to get him to come away from a chipmunk even for raw steak! They are naturally lively and can be very rowdy if they do not receive enough daily mental and physical exercise. Train this dog not to jump on humans. The Airedale Terrier needs proper obedience training and an owner who knows how to be \\\"Top Dog\\\" The Airedale Terrier may have dominance challenges toward family members he sees as submissive. This can lead to willfulness and disobedience. They are not difficult to train, but they do not respond to harsh, overbearing training methods. The Airedale Terrier is intelligent enough to perceive quickly what is required of it, but if you ask it to do the same thing over and over again it may refuse. Try to give it some variety to its training, making the exercise a challenge. They need a calm, but firm, confident and consistent handler. With the right handler, the Airedale Terrier can do well in various dog sports including defense dog trials. This breed generally gets along well with household cats and other animals, but they sometimes try to dominate other dogs. This depends upon the way the humans around the dog treat him, their training and the individual dog.\",\"height\":\"Males 22 - 24 inches (56 - 61 cm) Females 22 - 23 inches (56 - 58 cm)\",\"weight\":\"Males 50 - 65 pounds (23 - 29 kg) Females 40 - 45 pounds (18 - 20 kg)\",\"healthProblems\":\"A very hardy breed, although some may suffer from eye problems, hip dysplasia and skin infections. If your Airedale Terrier has dry skin, he should be fed an adjusted omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid ratio in the diet.\",\"livingConditions\":\"The Airedale Terrier is not recommended for apartment life. They are very active indoors and will do best with at least an average-sized yard.\",\"exercise\":\"Airedales were bred for active work, and therefore need plenty of exercise. They need to be taken for long daily walks. Most of them love to play with a ball, swim or retrieve objects and once fully grown will happily run alongside a bicycle. Without enough attention and exercise the Airedale Terrier will become restless and bored and will usually get itself into trouble. The exercise requirement can go down somewhat after the first two years (as with many dogs) but the first two years with an Airedale are very strenuous on the human. Then they start to get mellower.\",\"lifeExpectancy\":\"About 10-12 years.\",\"litterSize\":\"Average of 9 puppies\",\"grooming\":\"Airedales have a hard, short-haired, double coat. The hair should be plucked about twice a year, but for dogs that are to be shown, much more intensive grooming is needed. Trim excessive hair between the pads of the feet when necessary. If you keep the coat stripped it will shed little to no hair, however if you do not strip the coat, you will most likely find fur piles around your baseboards, even with trimming and brushing almost every day. They actually require a good bit of grooming. Burrs stick in the coat and beard. The beard should be washed daily because of food residue. Airedale Terriers can be good for some allergy sufferers.\",\"origin\":\"The first Airedales looked completely different from the Airedales of today. They were originally known as the Waterside and Bingley Terriers, descended from the now extinct black-and-tan type terrier. The breed was later crossed with the Otterhound to make him a better swimmer. It is also said to have Manchester Terrier in its blood. They were developed about a hundred years ago in the country of York from the ancient Working Terrier. The Airedale is often called \\\"The King of Terriers.\\\" The breed was used as a vermin hunter and was named for the Valley of the Aire in England, which was heavily populated with small game. In addition to his role as a small game hunter, the Airedale has been used to hunt big game in India, Africa and Canada. The breed was also used as a police dog and a wartime guard in World War II. Today the Airedale is primarily a companion dog, but there are still working lines out there. Some of the Airedale's talents are guarding, watchdog, hunting, rodent control, tracking, military work, police work and competitive obedience.\"},{\"name\":\"akita\",\"description\":\"The largest of the Japanese Spitz-type breeds, the Akita, pronounced a-KEE-ta, is a powerful, solid, well-proportioned and distinctive looking dog. Strong and muscular with a flat, heavy head and strong, short muzzle, the Akita has a deep, broad chest and a level back. The dog is slightly longer than he is tall. The head is triangular shaped, broad and blunt. The stop, which is the transition area from the backskull to the muzzle, is well-defined. A shallow furrow extends well up the forehead. The ears are small and erect, carried forward and in line with the neck. The dark brown eyes are small and triangular in shape. The nose is broad and black. Brown is permitted on white Akitas, but black is preferred. The lips are black and the tongue is pink. The teeth are strong and should meet in a scissors or level bite (scissors is preferred by most breeders). The tail is plush and carried over the dog's back. The webbed feet are cat-like. The Akita is double coated. The outer coat is harsh and waterproof. The undercoat is thick and soft, providing nice insulation for the dog in cold weather. Coat colors are pure white, red, sesame, brindle and fawn. The colors should be without clear borders. A black mask is forbidden.\",\"temperament\":\"The Akita is docile, intelligent, courageous and fearless. Careful and very affectionate with its family. Sometimes spontaneous, it needs a firm, confident, consistent pack leader. Without it the dog will be very willful and may become very aggressive toward other dogs and animals. It needs firm training as a puppy. The objective in training this dog is to achieve a pack leader status. It is a natural instinct for a dog to have an order in their pack. When we humans live with dogs, we become their pack. The entire pack cooperates under a single leader. Lines are clearly defined. You and all other humans MUST be higher up in the order than the dog. That is the only way your relationship can be a success. If the dog is allowed to believe he is the leader over the humans he may become very food-possessive as he tells the humans to wait their turn. He eats first. The Akita Inu is a first-class guard dog. Japanese mothers would often leave their children in the family Akita's care. They are extremely faithful and thrive on firm leadership from their handlers. It should definitely be supervised with other household pets and children. Although the breed may tolerate and be good with children from his own family, if you do not teach this dog he is below all humans in the pack order he may not accept other children and if teased, Akita's may bite. Children must be taught to display leadership qualities and at the same time respec the dog. With the right type of owner, the proper amount of daily mental and physical exercise and firm training, they can make a fine pet. Obedience training requires patience, as these dogs tend to get bored quickly. The Akita Inu needs to be with its family. It vocalizes with many interesting sounds, but it is not an excessive barker.\",\"height\":\"Males 24 - 26 inches (61 - 66 cm) Females 24 - 26 inches (61 - 66 cm)\",\"weight\":\"Females 75 - 120 pounds (34 - 54 kg) Females 75 - 110 pounds (34 - 50 kg.)\",\"healthProblems\":\"Prone to hip dysplasia, both hypothyroid and autoimmune thyroiditis, immune diseases like VKH and Pemphigus, skin problems like SA and eyes (PRA, Micro, entropion) patella and other problems with the knee.\",\"livingConditions\":\"The Akita Inu will do okay in an apartment if it is sufficiently exercised.

Brush with a firm bristle brush, and bathe only when absolutely necessary as bathing removes the natural waterproofing of the coat. This breed sheds heavily twice a year.\",\"origin\":\"There are two types of Akitas, the original Japanese Akita breed and now a separate designation for American standard Akitas. The weights and sizes are different and the American standard allows for a black mask, whereas the original Japanese breed standard does not allow a black mask. According to the FCI, in Japan and in many other countries around the world the American Akita is considered a separate breed from the Akita Inu (Japanese Akita). In the United States and Canada, both the American Akita and the Akita Inu are considered a single breed with differences in type rather than two separate breeds.

A well-built and hardy animal, it is a versatile working dog. It has a wide, flat head with a muzzle that narrows toward a black nose. The eyes are small and dark and the ears are pendant. Its tail is carried rolled up on its back. Its limbs are straight. Its short double coat is considerably tight, thick and glossy. The basic colors are black or brown with symmetrical white and rust markings. A white blaze and rust marking over the eyes must be present on the head. Rust is always between the black and the white.\",\"temperament\":\"Charming and affectionate, tough, sober, brave, intelligent and lively, the Appenzell usually gets along well with other dogs and mixes well with livestock and household animals if it has become used to them while still young. They are rather unsure of strangers but greet family and friends effusively. A well brought up Appenzell Mountain Dog that understands his lower place in the human pack is fine with children. Loyal to the whole family, but tends to bond closely with one person, it responds best to firm, but consistent, even-tempered training. Socialize this dog well with all kinds of situations, people and other animals. Appenzells learn quickly, partly because they are so intelligent, but also because they really want to have something to do. This breed enjoys the outdoors, loving freedom and open spaces to run. Agility skill trials and games of catch are suitable sports for this breed. Potential problems arise when owners are not the dog’s firm, confident, consistent pack leaders displaying the proper authority over the dog.

You and all other humans MUST be higher up in the order than the dog. That is the only way your relationship can be a success. They need to be taken for a daily walk or jog to release mental and physical energy. Lack of leadership and/or lack of mental and physical exercise can cause a wide variety of behavioral issues, including but not limited to, obsessive barking, over-protectiveness/ guarding, destructiveness, and a high-strung, neurotic temperament. This working dog is not going to happily lie around your home like a couch potato. They do best when given a job to do. If you do not provide this for them, they will take it upon themselves to find a job and it will not be something you like. This breed makes a good watchdog. These are great dogs for the active outdoor type.\",\"height\":\"Males 22 - 23 inches (56 - 58.5 cm) Females 18 - 20 inches (46 - 50 cm)\",\"weight\":\"49 - 70 pounds (22 - 32 kg)\",\"healthProblems\":\"A fairly healthy breed.\",\"livingConditions\":\"The Appenzell Mountain Dog is not recommended for apartment life. They prefer to live outdoors and should have acreage where they can run free, such as a farm. Appenzells that do not have acreage need extra attention to their mental and physical exercise needs. They like to bark, so they are not suited for areas with close neighbors, however giving them the proper amount of leadership and exercise can lessen their urge to bark.\",\"exercise\":\"The Appenzell does not belong in a busy urban environment or in the suburbs if you are not a very active jogging/fast walking type. It does best when it can live on a farm where it has room to run. Its strong herding instincts keep it from running off. It prefers to be outdoors and closely bonds with its territory.

One, that it is a native breed dating back to the Bronze Age, the other: it descended from the Molossus and was brought into Switzerland by the Romans. In any case it is one of the four Swiss Sennenhunds. The Appenzell is the rarest of the four. It is an outstanding herd dog, tireless and surefooted in the mountains. It is also adaptable to pulling a cart and is used to bring milk and cheese from the valleys to the merchants in town. It does not have a lazy bone in its body.

The head is wrinkled around the forehead and the muzzle is shorter than the skull, Which is flat. The small, almond-shaped eyes are dark hazel to dark brown. The ears are straight, small, erect and open in the front. The dog's back is level and the legs are straight. The tail is set high and curled over to either side. The coat is short, shiny and fine and comes in pure black, copper, red, chestnut red, or tricolor in combinations of black, tan and white, or black, brindle and white. The AKC standard calls for the dog to have white on the feet, chest and tip of the tail. White legs, blaze and collar are optional. The Basenji does not bark, but rather makes a yodel noise. It also howls, growls and crows, depending on the dog's mood.\",\"temperament\":\"The Basenji is alert, affectionate, energetic and curious. It loves to play and makes a good pet, as long as it is handled regularly from an early age. It is very intelligent and responds well to training with a strong desire to please. It can be reserved with strangers, so socialize well. The Basenji is somewhat reserved, but can still form strong bonds with humans. It should not be trusted with non-canine pets. It does best with children who understand how to display leadership toward the dog. The Basenji dislikes wet weather. It likes to chew, so giving it lots of toys of its own would be a good idea. The breed likes to climb and can easily get over chain wire fences. It has the unique properties of not barking (it makes a low, liquid ululation instead) and of cleaning itself like a cat. It can be described as speedy, frisky and tireless at play. Most Basenji problems usually involve a mismatch between owner and pet. The owners mistake the adjective \\\"quiet” to mean inactive instead of noiseless; thus, they become harassed by an active, though relatively silent, dog. Basenjis need daily exercise to release mental and physical energy. Basenjis are very clever at getting their own way; they succeed less by obstinacy than by charm, and therefore need an owner who displays natural authority. one who makes rules and sticks to them. Calm, but firm, confident and consistent, Basenjis who have meek or passive owners, or owners who are not consistent with the rules will become demanding. The dog will assume the role of pack leader and behavior problems will arise, especially when left alone.

Also called the Congo Dog, it was first introduced to England in 1937. English breeders refined it and exported it all over the world. In Africa the dog was used by the natives as a guide in the forest, to warn against the approach of dangerous animals, for pointing and retrieving of small game and driving game into nets. The first litter of Basenji puppies born and raised to maturity in the USA was in 1941 and the breed was first recognized by the AKC in 1944.\"},{\"name\":\"beagle\",\"description\":\"The Beagle is a sturdy, hardy little hound dog that looks like a miniature Foxhound.

The Beagle is excellent with children and generally good with other dogs, but because of its hunting instincts, should not be trusted with non-canine pets, unless socialized with cats and other household animals when young. Beagles have minds of their own. They are determined and watchful and require patient, firm training. It is important you are this dog's pack leader and that you provide the proper amount of mental and physical exercise, including daily pack walks, to avoid separation anxiety. With enough exercise they will be calm. You can also purchase animal scents and play tracking games with your Beagle to help satisfy its instinct to track. The Beagle does not have a normal sounding bark, but rather a loud bay cry that almost sounds like a short howl. Beagles are curious and have a tendency to follow their noses. If they pick up a scent they may wander off and not even hear you calling them back, or care to listen, as they will be too busy trying to find the critter at the other end. Take care when letting them off leash that you are in a safe area. Beagles that are allowed to be pack leaders over their humans can develop a varying degree of behavior issues, including, but not limited to, guarding, obsessive barking, snapping, biting and destructive behaviors when left alone. These are not Beagle traits, but rather behaviors brought on by lack of leadership and/or exercise from their humans.

The breed can hunt alone, in pairs or in packs. The name \\\"Beagle\\\" may have come from the French term \\\"be’geule\\\" which means “gape throat,” referring to the dogs baying voice. The name may also have come from the dog's size, stemming from the French word “beigh,” the Old English word “begele,” or perhaps the Celtic word “beag,” which all mean \\\"small.\\\" He has also served as an excellent narcotics detection dog and makes a fine family companion.

Do not let this breed off the leash in an unsafe area, as they may take off after an interesting scent. They have a strong instinct to tree animals. Raccoons inhabit all states and provinces in the US mainland and Canada, and have for centuries been pursued by hunters. Each year, hundreds of licensed night trials take place. Each trial lasts approximately three hours and involves three to four dogs. Points are given according to the dog's ability to find, trail and tree a raccoon. Points are lost for treeing game other than raccoons. Each dog has a unique \\\"voice\\\" which its owners usually can recognize. The Bluetick does not have a normal sounding bark, but rather a loud bay cry that almost sounds like a short howl. Blueticks are curious and have a tendency to follow their noses. If they pick up a scent they may wander off and not even hear you calling them back, or not care to listen, as they will be too busy trying to find the critter at the other end. Take care when letting them off leash that you are in a safe area. The Bluetick has extremely good eyesight, which allows it to work well at night. The Bluetick Coonhound excels in these trials. They can also be used to track fox or even cougar. The Bluetick has a fearless and warrior-like approach to the hunt. This breed may drool or slobber.\",\"height\":\"20 - 27 inches (51 - 69 cm)\",\"weight\":\"45 - 80 pounds (20 - 36 kg)\",\"healthProblems\":\"Prone to hip dysplasia, cataracts and Krabbes disease.\",\"livingConditions\":\"The Bluetick is not recommended for apartment life. They are relatively inactive indoors and will do best with at least a large yard. Do not let this breed run free off of its lead unless in a safe, secure area. Coonhounds have a tendency to follow their noses, and if they catch wind of a scent, they may wander off for hours following it.\",\"exercise\":\"Daily vigorous exercise is needed, which includes a long, brisk daily walk. Coonhounds that do not receive enough mental and physical exercise may become high strung and even destructive. This very anxious and energetic dog has been bred for severe physical exercise. Coonhounds are born natural hunters, so they have a tendency to run off and hunt if they are not kept well-fenced while exercising on their own. They have no road sense at all, so they must be kept in a safe environment.\",\"lifeExpectancy\":\"About 11-12 years\",\"litterSize\":\"About 6 to 8 puppies\",\"grooming\":\"An occasional brushing will do. In order to keep the ears clean and infection-free, regular attention is a must.\",\"origin\":\"The Bluetick Coonhound is the state dog of Tennessee, where it is said to have originated. Selective breeding in Louisiana of Foxhounds, Curs, French Hounds and English Coonhounds produced the Bluetick Coonhound. The Bluetick was originally recognized by the UKC as the English fox & Coonhound, which included the Bluetick,Treeing Walker and English Coonhounds all in the same breed. The breeds were later separated into their own breed. In 2008 the Bluetick Coonhound was recognized by the AKC in the Miscellaneous Class.\"},{\"name\":\"borzoi\",\"description\":\"The Borzoi is similar in shape to the Greyhound. It has a narrow, slightly domed head with almost no stop. The long muzzle is slightly arched. The teeth meet in a level or scissors bite. The large nose is black. The dark eyes have a slant to them. The small ears lay back on the head. The back line is arched slightly upward and the chest is narrow, but deep. The front legs are straight. The tail is set low with a curve. The coat is long, silky, flat or wavy. The hair on the neck, hindquarters and tail is longer than the hair on the rest of the body. Comes in any color or combination of colors; common colors include black, white, tan, tan or gray with black markings, golden in either solid or mixed colors.\",\"temperament\":\"The Borzoi is a sweet, intelligent dog. It is proud and is extremely loyal to its family. It is quite affectionate with people it knows well. They can be trained in obedience, but it should be remembered that they are hounds, and as such are more free-thinking and less willing to please humans than some breeds. They are, however, very intelligent and capable learners. The training of this breed needs to be gentle, but firm and consistent. The Borzoi needs an owner who displays a natural authority over him, making the rules of the home clear and confidently sticking to them. Borzoi often appear to be cat-like in that they keep themselves quite clean. They are quiet dogs, rarely barking. Like all other sighthounds, they are very fast and have little to no territorial instinct. Therefore, they cannot be trusted off leash, unless in a securely fenced or very safe area. If they get sight of a small animal they may take off after it and not even hear you calling them back. They are good with other dogs but should be supervised with small non-canine pets such as cats, rabbits, guinea pigs and hamsters. Spending time outdoors with small animals is not advised. Socialize them very well with cats and other pets at as young an age as possible, but remember the Borzoi will always be a hunter that may race after a fleeing animal. The Borzoi is a noble dog that gets along fairly well with children, but it is not ideally suited for being a child's companion as it does not take well to roughhousing play. During the growing stage, these dogs need a highly nutritional diet.\",\"height\":\"Males at least 28 inches (71 cm) Females at least 26 inches (66 cm)\",\"weight\":\"Males 75 - 105 pounds (34 – 48 kg) Females 60 - 90 pounds (27 - 41kg)\",\"healthProblems\":\"Prone to bloat.

Brush regularly with a firm bristle brush, and dry shampoo when necessary. Bathing presents a problem with such a tall dog, but shouldn't be required very often. Clip the hair between the toes to keep the feet comfortable and to stop them from spreading. This breed is a seasonally heavy shedder.\",\"origin\":\"The Borzoi was bred for hundreds of years by Russian nobility. They were developed by crossing the Arabian Greyhound with other longer haired Russian sheepdogs. The dogs were called Russian Wolfhounds in America up until 1936 when the name was changed to \\\"Borzoi,\\\" coming from the Russian word ”borzii,” which means swift. Fierce on the hunt, this sighthound was used for hundreds of years to hunt wolves, fox and hare in the open planes of Russia. As the breed became more popular it was used more and more as a companion dog and its temperament became more docile. The Borzoi was recognized by the AKC in 1891. The Borzoi’s talents include hunting, sighting and lure coursing.\"},{\"name\":\"bouvier\",\"description\":\"The Bouvier is a large, powerful, rugged-looking dog. The head is in proportion to the body, giving the dog a square profile. The broad, somewhat short back has a firm, level topline. The head is flat, slightly longer than it is wide. The skull is parallel with the muzzle, which is wide between the ears. The muzzle is slightly tapered, broad and strong. The nose is black. The bushy eyebrows make the stop more pronounced than it really is. The teeth meet in a scissors bite. The dark brown eyes are oval in shape with black eye rims. The triangular ears are set high, either cropped or left natural. The well-muscled back legs are powerful and the front legs are straight. The tail is set high and usually docked. Note: it is illegal to crop or dock a dog's body parts (tail and ears) in most parts of Europe. Dewclaws are usually removed. The double coat is weather-resistant with rough, harsh outer hairs. The undercoat is fine and soft but dense. The coat is cut so it has a shaggy, thick beard and eyebrows, giving the dog a distinctive look. Coat colors come in black, fawn, blonde, salt and pepper, gray or brindle. Sometimes it has a small white star on the chest. Solid black coats are not favored in the show ring, but are accepted and blonde coats are not accepted. Dutch bloodlines are often larger and heavier than Belgian lines.\",\"temperament\":\"The Bouvier des Flandres is an obedient dog that may look intimidating, but is actually pleasant natured and gentle. With the proper amount of exercise it will also be calm. Enthusiastic, responsible, even tempered and fearless, it is an excellent guard and watchdog that is easy to train. This breed learns commands relatively fast, though not quite as fast as, for example the German Shepherd. They require well-balanced training that remains consistent in nature. Once they learn a command they will remember it for the rest of their life. It is important to consistently make the dog aware, without being harsh or rough, that you are and will remain the boss. This breed needs an experienced owner to prevent dominance and over-protectiveness problems. He should be socialized well, preferably starting at an early age to avoid shyness, suspiciousness, and reservations with strangers. Protection of the family when danger is present is not something that needs to be taught, nor is it something you can train out of them. The dog will arise to the occasion if needed. A good family dog, the Bouvier likes and is excellent with children. The Bouvier is very adaptable and goes about its business quietly and calmly. This dog's loyalty is world famous. Obedience train this breed at an early age. Their behavior in general and with other animals depends on the owners’ ability to be alpha over the dog, communicating what is expected and the individual dominancy level of the dog. Provided they are properly socialized at an early age, chances are they will get along well with cats and other pets, but take caution with non-canine pets. They are usually good with other dogs if they are raised with them from puppyhood.  More dominant individuals can be dog-aggressive if the owners are not alpha and do not communicate to the dog that fighting is unwanted.

Between trims remove any excess hair inside the ears and trim hair between the pads of the feet. Do not let the hair grow too long close to the feet; trim it so that the Bouvier has nice, round feet. A well-groomed Bouvier sheds very little hair in the home. Some Bouvier owners have reported the Bouvier to be good for allergy sufferers.\",\"origin\":\"There is no real agreement concerning the origin of this Franco-Belgian breed. It may have been formed by crossing the Griffon and the Beauceron. The breed originated in Belgium by the working class who were not interested in creating a show dog, but rather wanted a working dog. Farmers, butchers and cattle merchants used the dogs in their everyday work. While the dogs varied in size and look, they still were similar enough to recognize them as a Bouvier. Bouvier des Flandres means \\\"cowherd from Flanders.\\\" The dogs were labeled several nicknames as well, such as \\\"koehond\\\" (meaning cow dog), \\\"Vuilbaard\\\" (meaning dirty beard) and \\\"toucheur de boeuf\\\" or \\\"pic\\\" (meaning cattle driver). Later they were used as a message-carrier and rescue dog during World War I. Like most breeds during the world wars, the Bouvier was almost killed off. In 1923 a group of individuals worked at recreating the Bouvier breed and a breed club was formed in Belgium. Some of the Bouvier talents are watchdog, guardian, tracking dog, guide for the blind, search and rescue, police work, military work, carting, agility, competitive obedience and Schutzhund.\"},{\"name\":\"boxer\",\"description\":\"The Boxer's body is compact and powerful.

The muscular front legs are straight and parallel when viewed from the front. The back legs are well muscled. The tail is set high and usually docked. The AKC severely penalizes a natural tail, while most of Europe has outlawed this practice. Dewclaws are usually removed.

Highly intelligent, eager and quick to learn, the Boxer is a good dog for competitive obedience. It is constantly on the move and bonds very closely with the family. Loyal and affectionate, Boxers are known for the way they get along so well with children. A well brought-up and properly socialized Boxer will also get along with his own kind and other household pets such as cats. Animals such as rodents, ducks, chickens and other farm birds may be too tempting, however, they can be taught to \\\"leave it\\\" but it is still not recommended they be left alone with them. It has been said that the name Boxer came from the way the Boxer likes to use his front paws for just about everything. If you have ever watched a Boxer go about his business you may have noticed the way he paws at his toys, food bowl and you for that matter, in a very playful cat-like way. While participating the sport of Schutzhund, Boxers are known to jump up and use their front paws as if they are boxing. They are very clownish and playful. The Boxer's nature is to protect you, your family, and your home. Known visitors will be welcomed. They are always keen to work and play. Boxers need lots of human leadership. Teach the Boxer not to be boisterous and especially not to jump up at people. This breed is noted for courage and makes a great guard dogs. Boxers have a wide use in military and police work. An excellent watchdog, the Boxer will restrain an intruder in the same way a Bulldog does. They are extremely athletic, sometimes even in their old age. This dog needs to go on a daily pack walk. Daily mental and physical exercise is paramount. Without it, the Boxer will become high strung. This breed requires a dominant owner. Training should start young and be firm and consistent. The objective in training this dog is to achieve pack leader status. It is a natural instinct for a dog to have an order in its pack. When we humans live with dogs, we become their pack. The entire pack cooperates under a single leader; lines are clearly defined. You and all other humans MUST be higher up in the order than the dog. That is the only way your relationship can be a success. Meek Boxer owners will find their dogs to become stubborn.

The Boxer's ancestors were two German mastiff type dogs, the Bullenbeiszer and the Barenbeiszer. They were later crossed with the powerful ancestors of the Mastiff and Bulldog. Early Boxers were used for dog fighting, bull baiting, cart pulling, as cattle dogs, to round up livestock and to catch and pin wild boar and bison until hunters could arrive. They later became popular theater and circus dogs. The first Boxer studbook was started in 1904. Up until then the dogs varied widely in looks and size. The Boxer is known for the way it uses its front legs to bat at its opponent, appearing to be boxing, most likely giving the dog its name. Some of the Boxer's talents are watchdog, guarding, police work, military work, search and rescue, competitive obedience, Schutzhund and performing tricks.

The large head is round with a domed forehead and a deep stop. The muzzle is very short, appearing to be pushed back. The black nose is very short. The dog has an overbite with a hanging tongue. The black eyes are wide set and prominent with long, black eyelashes. The ears are high set, either cropped or left natural. Natural ears are carried semi-erect; when cropped the ears stand up coming to a point. The straight boned legs are medium in length. The tail is set high and docked to about 1/3 of the length. Note: cropping ears or docking tails is illegal in most of Europe. There are two types of coats, rough and smooth. The rough coat is dense and wiry. On the smooth coat, also called the Petit Brabancon variety, the fur is short, tight, glossy and straight. The short coats are easier to groom. Coat colors include red (reddish brown with a little black at the whiskers and chin), belge (a mixture of red-brown and black usually with black mask and whiskers), black and tan (black with reddish brown markings under the chin, legs, above each eye, the edges of the ears and around the vent), and solid black.\",\"temperament\":\"The Griffon is an intelligent cheerful dog with a terrier-like disposition. With lots of personality, it makes a fine companion dog and is good with other dogs and cats. Affectionate, charming, lively and curious, they love everyone. The Griffon cannot live outside in a kennel. If you feed them table scraps, they may become greedy or picky eaters. May be difficult to housebreak. They make good watchdogs and can be taught to perform tricks. Because of this dog’s almost human looking facial expression, they have not only been nicknamed \\\"monkey face,\\\" but are prone to being treated as if they are not dogs, but little humans. This causes something called Small Dog Syndrome. The dog begins to believe IT is the ruler of the home, and IT tells ITS humans what they can and cannot do. When a human allows a dog to take over the home, it causes varying degrees of behavior problems, including, but not limited to, willfulness, demanding, obsessive barking,  guarding, separation anxiety, snapping and even biting. They may become untrustworthy with children and sometimes even adults. Without enough mental and physical exercise, they will become high-strung, moody and sensitive.

The Belgian Griffon has a long, wiry coat with fringe around the face. The Brussels Griffon has a wiry coat that is longer than the Belgian Griffon’s. The Petit Brabancon has a short, smooth coat. The Brussels Griffon was first shown at the Brussels Exhibition of 1880. An early example of the breed is depicted in a Van Eyck, the Flemish painter. Once kept by cab drivers of 17th century Brussels to rid their stables of vermin, the Brussels Griffon became a companion breed by virtue of its appealing character. The smooth coated Petit Brabancon was most likely crossed with Pug blood. Other breeds including the Affenpinscher, English Toy Spaniel, Belgian street dog, Yorkshire Terrier and Irish Terrier may have contributed to the modern Griffons. The AKC recognizes only the variety known as the Brussels Griffon. Its American standard allows all of the color varieties, black through red, as well as the smooth variety (Brabancon). FCI, conversely, divided them into three breeds: smooth (Petit Brabancon), rough reds (Brussels Griffon) and roughs of other colors (Belgian Griffon). Therefore, in Europe they are shown separately with no interbreeding between the varieties. In America, although the same parameters exist, they are combined into one breed with different colors and coat varieties. It was a Brussels Griffon that appeared in the movie \\\"As Good as it Gets.\\\" Somewhat rare, Griffons may be very difficult to find.\"},{\"name\":\"briard\",\"description\":\"The Briard is a large, powerful herding dog. In males, the body is about the same length as the height, but in females the length may be slightly longer. The topline is straight. The head is large, long and rectangular in shape. The wide muzzle has a long mustache and beard. The stop is well marked. The square-shaped nose is black with open nostrils. Teeth meet in a scissors bite. The large eyes are set wide apart and come in black or black-brown with very dark pigmentation along the rims. Eyes are covered with hair which cascades to the rest of the body. The ears are either cropped or left natural, set high, not lying flat to the head. The legs are powerful with strong bone. The well-feathered, low-cut tail has a J-shaped crook at the end. The feet are large, compact and round. The nails are black. The dog usually has double dewclaws on the hind feet and they may or may not be removed. The Briard has a double coat. The outer coat is coarse, hard and dry, lying flat and falling naturally in long, slightly wavy locks. The undercoat is fine and tight all over the body. Coat comes in all colors except for white. Common colors include black, various shades of gray and various shades of tawny. The tawny coat usually lightens from the time the dog is born to the time it is a year old, when the coat deepens to a richer adult color. Adult coats are 6 or more inches (16 cm) long, giving the dog a bushy look with a shaggy beard, eyebrows and mustache.\",\"temperament\":\"The Briard is a farm worker by nature and lives to herd anything, possessing an exceptional hearing ability. It is kind, but with a strong protective instinct. The Briard makes a wonderful, alert watchdog. Sensitive, playful and obedient, but with a definite mind of its own. A long history of working with humans has left it gentle and sweet-natured, as well as loyal, brave and fearless. This breed has a fine memory and is intelligent with a lot of ambition. The Briard is very trainable, willing and eager to please. It needs a firm owner who is able to display leadership at all times. This is definitely not a breed for everyone. Too often they wind up in shelters because people don't realize what a challenge they can be to raise and live with. If they sense the owner is letting up on the authority at all they will become very stubborn and can be fearful, extremely unfriendly, or both, if not treated like a dog. They not only need a lot of leadership, but they need entertainment and activity to be happy, and are not the sort you can pat on the head and ignore the rest of the day. Briards are really dedicated to their families and tend to be, at best, disinterested in other people. They should be socialized early—especially with children. They are good-natured and very adaptable to living with children if they are raised together. This breed does not like to be teased. Train them early and treat them with an air of leadership along with exercise first and then affection, and you will have a wonderful family dog. It has been said, \\\"it returns tenfold any affection given to it.\\\" Affection should only be given when the dog is calm and in a submissive state. Training must be consistent with patience and a firm hand. Owners need to be stern, confident and consistent. They will not respond to unjust harshness. Dogs in general do not respond well to or understand anger. Firmness they do definitely need, but not anger. With poor handling and training the Briard becomes withdrawn and even aggressive. They require regular leadership, training and attention. If you are a first-time dog owner and you would like to raise a Briard, be sure to research the breed extensively before adopting. Briards view strangers as suspicious and can be a bit dog aggressive, but with the right handler it will blossom into a first-class pet that can happily coexist with other pets. Briards may attempt to herd people by nipping at their heels, and need to be taught not to do this.\",\"height\":\"Males 24 - 27 inches (62 - 68 cm) Females 22 - 25 inches (56 - 64 cm)\",\"weight\":\"75 pounds (35 kg)\",\"healthProblems\":\"Generally healthy, but some lines are prone to PRA, cataracts and hip dysplasia.

The Briard became popular only after the Paris dog show of 1863. In 1897 the first shepherd dog club was founded and both the Beauceron and the Briard were accepted into it. Prior to 1889 the Beauceron and Briard had a reputation of being a flock guard who was brave but one who was more incline to snap and bite in defense of its flock. Both breed's temperaments were softened through selective breeding. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned Briards. Centuries ago the Briard was used to defend its charges against poachers and wolves and by the French army, ignoring exploding bombs and artillery fire. The dogs were used to run messages, detect mines, pick up trails, support commando actions, find the wounded, and carry food and ammunition to the front lines. The Briard may have been named after Aubry of Montdidier, who owned an early Briard, or for the French province of Brie, although the dog probably does not originate in that area. The Briard was recognized by the AKC in 1928. The Briard still serves as a flock guardian and herder. They also make great family companion dogs.

This breed is good with family pets, but some can be combative with strange dogs if they do not see themselves as followers in their pack. When Bulldogs are young, they are full of energy, but slow down as they get older. They snore very loudly, most have drool and slobber tendencies and are messy eaters. Bulldogs that display guarding behaviors, such as guarding furniture, food, toys, or other spots in the house, or that are dog aggressive do not have humans who are being the dog's pack leader. This behavior only happens when dogs are allowed to take over. These behaviors can be corrected when the owners start displaying the proper leadership. Dogs that feel they need to run the home are not as happy as dogs that know they are human followers, as it is very stressful for a dog to need to keep \\\"his\\\" humans in line.\",\"height\":\"about 12 - 16 inches (31 - 40 cm) \",\"weight\":\"Males 53 - 55 pounds (24 - 25 kg) Females 49 - 51 pounds (22 - 23 kg)\",\"healthProblems\":\"Prone to breathing problems; some have small windpipes as well. Also poor eyesight, cherry eye, very susceptible to heatstroke in warm weather or hot rooms and cars. Very cold sensitive. Prone to mast cell tumors. Birth defects are common in some lines. Susceptible to skin infections, hip and knee problems. Prone to flatulence, especially when fed any other type of food other than their regular dog food. Puppies are often delivered by caesarian section. Some say it is because of the dogs' large head size, however others claim you can hardly tell the difference between the head size of a Bulldog with the head size of other breeds when the pups are first born; claiming not enough dams are given the opportunity to try and deliver naturally because of the large head myth. A lot of Bulldogs do run the risk of having weak labors and this could increase the risk of a caesarian.\",\"livingConditions\":\"The English Bulldog is good for apartment life. They are very inactive indoors and will do okay without a yard. This breed is an indoor dog. Bulldogs do best in temperate climates as the breed can chill easily in cold weather and have trouble cooling off in very hot weather.\",\"exercise\":\"The English Bulldog needs to be taken on a daily walk to fulfill its primal canine instinct to migrate. Those individuals that do not get this need met are more likely to have behavior issues. While out on the walk the dog must be made to heel beside or behind the person holding the lead, as in a dog's mind the leader leads the way, and that leader needs to be the human. Teach them to enter and exit all door and gateways after the human. English Bulldogs that are in good shape are capable of moving very quickly for short periods of time.\",\"lifeExpectancy\":\"An average of 8 years. Some live longer while others live shorter lives.\",\"litterSize\":\"4 - 5 puppies; as a result of this breed's large head they are prone to needing a caesarian section\",\"grooming\":\"The smooth, fine, short-haired coat is easy to groom. Comb and brush with a firm bristle brush, and bathe only when necessary. Wipe the face with a damp cloth every day to clean inside the wrinkles. This breed is an average shedder.\",\"origin\":\"The English Bulldog originated in the British Isles, descended from the ancient Asiatic mastiff. The dog was given the name \\\"bull\\\" because of its use in bull baiting and for its robust look of a little bull. They were aggressive, ferocious and courageous with the power to attack full grown bulls, which they did in arena combat before the practice was banned by law in the 19th century. Bulldogs would attack from the bottom up going underneath the bull and aiming for the neck, making it hard for the bull to fight back. Today's Bulldog has a very different temperament from those of his ancestors, but still retains a strong determination.\"},{\"name\":\"bullterrier\",\"description\":\"The Bull Terrier is a strongly built, muscular dog. The body is well rounded with a short, strong back. The head is long and strong, oval-looking in shape, almost flat at the top, sloping evenly down to the nose with no stop. The nose is black. The eyes are almond-shaped, small and deep-set, dark in color. The ears are small, thin and close together. The long neck is very muscular, with robust shoulders. The tail is set low and on the short side, carried horizontally. The coat is dense, short, flat and harsh to the touch. The AKC recognizes two color varieties, the White Bull Terrier and the Colored Bull Terrier. The White Bull Terrier is allowed to have colored markings on the head, but nowhere else on the body. The Colored Bull Terriers may be black, brindle, black-brindle, red, fawn and tricolor with white markings.\",\"temperament\":\"Though this breed was once a fierce gladiator, he is much gentler now. A Bull Terrier might have a preventive effect and it might defend its owner in a truly critical situation, but it isn't bred to be a guard dog. Courageous, scrappy, fun-loving, active, clownish and fearless, the Bull Terrier is a loyal, polite, and obedient dog. They become very attached to their owners. The Bull Terrier thrives on firm, consistent leadership and affection and makes a fine family pet. Bull Terriers like to be doing something and fit in well with active families where they receive a great deal of companionship and supervision. They do not do well in situations where they are left alone for 8 hours a day. With the right type of owner this breed is a joy to own, but not recommended for most households. Fond of both grownups and children, but if they do not get enough physical and mental exercise they may be too energetic for small children. Children should be taught how to display leadership toward the dog. Meek owners will find them to become very protective, willful, possessive and/or jealous. Bull Terriers may try to join into family roughhousing or quarrel. They need very firm training and lots of exercise. Bull Terriers must be given a lot of structure, or they may become destructive. Be sure to socialize them well and remain their pack leader 100% of the time, otherwise, they can be extremely aggressive with other dogs. Unaltered males may not get along with other male dogs. They are not recommended with other non-canine pets such as rabbits, hamsters and guinea pigs. They make excellent watch dogs. This breed can be somewhat difficult to train.\",\"height\":\"20 - 24 inches (51 - 61 cm) \",\"weight\":\"45 - 80 pounds (20 - 36 kg)\",\"healthProblems\":\"Prone to slipped patella (dislocation of the kneecaps), heart defects, kidney failure and skin and flea allergies. Prone to suffer from a zinc deficiency, which can cause death. Gains weight easily. Do not overfeed. White Bull Terriers are prone to deafness.\",\"livingConditions\":\"Bull Terriers will do okay in an apartment if they are sufficiently exercised. They are fairly active indoors and a small yard will do. They prefer warm climates.\",\"exercise\":\"This breed needs vigorous daily exercise, which includes a daily, long walk. The Bull Terrier has a tendency to become overweight and lazy if it is not properly exercised.\",\"lifeExpectancy\":\"About 10-12 years\",\"litterSize\":\"As little as 1 puppy and as many as 9, average 5\",\"grooming\":\"The Bull Terrier is easy to groom. An occasional combing and brushing will do. This breed is an average shedder, shedding twice a year. You can remove loose hair by a daily rubdown with a special rubber glove.\",\"origin\":\"In the early 1800s Bulldogs crossed with terriers were popular. By 1830 combat between Bulldogs and bulls were at the height of their popularity. Lovers of this so-called \\\"sport\\\" decided to create a dog that would attack even more agilely. They crossed the Bulldog with the Old English Terrier, adding in some Spanish Pointer blood; the result was the Bull Terrier breed. They soon found that the Bull Terriers were not the most successful fighters. In 1860 the white-coated variety, which was nicknamed the \\\"White Cavalier\\\" was bred by English dog dealer James Hinks and soon became a fashionable pet for nobles. The colored variety of Bull Terriers was created by back-crossing them with brindle Staffordshires. The breed has been used as a guard, ratter, herder and watchdog. The Miniature was developed to have the same qualities as the Standard Bull Terrier but with a more manageable size. The Standard Bull Terrier was first recognized by the AKC in 1885 and the Miniature Bull Terrier in 1991. While the AKC sees the Standard Bull Terrier and the Miniature Bull Terrier as separate breeds, the standard requirements are the same except for size. Most other clubs see them as different varieties of the same breed or the same breed without placing a variety label. For example, the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale) has both breeds listed under Bull Terrier, separating them by a Standard and Miniature variety. The UKC (United Kennel Club) does not place any height or weight restrictions but does require the dog to be in proportion. The Bull Terrier was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948.\"}]";
